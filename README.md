# A-Decentralized-KYC-Verification-Process-for-Banks
This is a smart contract that can be used as a KYC (Know Your Customer) system by banks to keep track of their customers' 
information and their KYC status. The contract also allows the customers to be upvoted or downvoted by other banks, 
and stores the details of the bank complaints against other banks.
